# PyBer_Analysis

Overview: This analysis was conducted to assess ride sharing trends across cities and city types (rural vs urban) over a period of time. Data files were pulled from and manipulated in Jupyter Notebook using python scripts and python-based packages such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. The purpose of the analysis was exploratory in nature. Some questions considered were 1) what city type (rural, suburban, rural) had the greatest share of drivers offering ride sharing services? Similarly, what city type had the highest and lowest costs associated with ride sharing services? Lastly, how do trends in ride sharing services vary over a singular quarter period (Jan. to April)?
