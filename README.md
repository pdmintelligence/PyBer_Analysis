# PyBer_Analysis

Overview: This analysis was conducted to assess ride sharing trends across cities and city types (rural vs urban) over a period of time. Data files were pulled from and manipulated in Jupyter Notebook using python scripts and python-based packages such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. The purpose of the analysis was exploratory in nature. Some questions considered were 1) what city type (rural, suburban, rural) had the greatest share of drivers offering ride sharing services? Similarly, what city type had the highest and lowest costs associated with ride sharing services? Lastly, how do trends in ride sharing services vary over a singular quarter period (Jan. to April)?

# Results

Analysis: we observed the following: 


**1) General Observations: 

The data frame and charts below shows that during the period under review, Urban areas had the greatest share of total drivers offering ride sharing services (68.4%) and the lowest average fare cost per driver ($16.57). These figures are in contrast to rural areas which had the lowest total drivers offering ride sharing services (5.3%) and had the greatest average fare cost per driver ($55.49).

**1) Summary: 

In the summary section, we outline a few possible business recommendations for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1) The trend analysis shows that there was a general spike in ride sharing fare earnings at or about the tail end of Feb. 2019. It may be advisable to render additional analysis assessing what event(s) may be associated with the spike in ride share earnings. 

2) Rural regions appear to be associated with the greatest level of ride sharing fare earnings, compared to other city types. Nonetheless, Rural cities  appear to have the lowest number of drivers offering ride sharing services. It may be advisable to suggest a marketing strategy aimed at increasing the share of drivers offering ride share services in rural areas by capitalizing on their potential income earnings.

3) Lastly, it may be advisable to consider adding additional points to further disaggregate  city type characteristics. As an example, I am aware that federal databases have the additional categories of remote, fringe, and towns based on a city's distance from a major metropolitan statistical area. This may facilitate more nuanced analyses of ride sharing data.
